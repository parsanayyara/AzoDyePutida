This repository contains the codes (in Jupyter Notebook) used for designing a pathway in _P. putida KT2440_ to convert methyl red to actinorhodin; analyze growth coupling possibilities in glucose and methyl red (or both) using cMCS; and evaluate the strain designs suggested. The models used in this study are derived from the genome-scale reconstruction iJN1462 (Nogales et al. 2020).
